#Ignoring DS_Store files

DS_Store files are auto generated by many editors, such as Atom.  To ignore these files from a particular repo, simply include the file type in your `.gitignore` file.  This is what mine usually looks like:

```
# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
.DS_Store
```
Don't forget the period!    

Of course, once a file is tracked in your repository, it will continue to be tracked even if it matches an entry in an applicable `.gitignore` file.

You have to manually remove the `.DS_Store` files that were added to your repository. You can use:

```
git rm --cached .DS_Store
```

So `git rm --cached .DS_Store` removes only `.DS_Store` from the current directory. To remove all .DS_Stores from the repository use:

```
find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch
```

Ultimately, you probably never want to include `.DS_Store` files, so let's make a global rule. First, make a global `.gitignore` file somewhere:

```
echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global
```

Now tell git to use it for all repositories:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

And you're done.  :white_check_mark:    
Say goodbye to those pesky `DS_Store` files once and for all!
